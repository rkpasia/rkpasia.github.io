description_title: "My history"
description_about: "I am currently a student in Web and Multimedia Technologies at the University of Udine. Previously I attended the Technical Institute of Technology State Vito Volterra San Dona di Piave, obtaining the Diploma in Information Technology. In high school I discovered for the first time the environment of web development, to which I was introduced through the teaching of HTML. After my passion has grown exponentially and I have continued to fuel it by myself creating small personal projects to projects for competitions, such GoToWeb in which I was a finalist. Now, my passion has turned into a profession, to whom I dedicate all my enthusiasm and desire to learn new techniques and knowledge."
